          In the day and age of technology, we live in a fast-paced world that is constantly in motion and brimming with novel ideas. However, despite being connected through media and technology, we may unwittingly get caught in the rapid currents around us that disconnects us from reality. As a result, great ideas are often left untold.
          Connection is about building bridges between people, ideas and emotions. It allows us to establish relationships, gain insights and explore infinite possibilities.
          At TEDxSunwayUniversity, we believe that everyone has potential and ideas worth sharing. With this event, we aim to bring you on a journey to get a glimpse of the untold and to grow a community of bright minds that leave others inspired.
