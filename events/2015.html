        Many of us are used to hearing people say “be different” or “stand out of
        the crowd”, but what does it really mean to challenge the status quo? To do
        something different from everybody else? To exceed expectations that was
        thought impossible?
      </p>
      <p>
        At TEDxSunwayUniversity, we are delighted to have you in this journey with
        us to encourage the spread of good ideas and to be inspired by individuals
        who do not want to be just another face in the crowd. We invite you to
        challenge everything you know and not settle for anything else other than
        extraordinary. In going beyond what is conventional, go the extra mile with
        the hunger, drive and passion to be challenged and never be held back by
        your limitations. What does “beyond the status quo” mean to you?
