                        At TEDxSunwayUniversity, we aim to vouch the motto of TED, “Ideas Worth Spreading”, through entertainment, technology, 
                        and design. TEDxSunwayUniversity Club also serves as an avenue for Sunway students to organize events which will focus on 
                        individuality and innovation. The students involved will gain a bundle of knowledge and experience through the events that 
                        will be held.
                        <br><br>
                        The objectives of TEDxSunwayUniversity Club are to encourage students to be shaped by innovation, to encourage students to 
                        have confidence in their own ideas and to realize how powerful each idea are, 
                        to promote the culture of public speaking, and to promote learning through observation and discussion.

                        <br><br>
                        In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, 
                        self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, 
                        TED Talks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection. These local, self-organized 
                        events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for 
                        the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized. (Subject to certain rules and regulations.)

                        <br><br>
                        TED is a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading. Started as a four-day conference in California 30 years ago, 
                        TED has grown to support its mission with multiple initiatives. The two annual TED Conferences invite the world's leading 
                        thinkers and doers to speak for 18 minutes or less. Many of these talks are then made available, free, at TED.com. TED 
                        speakers have included Bill Gates, Jane Goodall, Elizabeth Gilbert, Sir Richard Branson, Nandan Nilekani, Philippe Starck, 
                        Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Sal Khan and Daniel Kahneman.

                        The annual TED Conference takes place each spring in Vancouver, British Columbia. TED's media initiatives include TED.com, where new TED

                        pproach to funding ideas with the potential to create change at thrilling scale; TEDx, which supports individuals or groups 
                        in hosting local, self- organized TED-style events around the world, and the TED Fellows program, helping world-changing 
                        innovators from around the globe to amplify the impact of their remarkable projects and activities.
